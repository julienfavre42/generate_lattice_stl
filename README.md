# generate_lattice_stl


This repository contains Python scripts to generate 3D lattice structures.
The following packages are required:

- A Linux environment with Python3
- ASE environment (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) used to generate the atomic positions and the crystal cell
- Openscad and/or Blender to generate the stl file
- XcrysDen to open the xsf crystallography files
- Povray and Imagemagick to generate 3D images, and to make a gif from it

You can run different commands listed at the end of the file cluster_graphics.py to get different outputs : stl, png, gif, or xsf file...
Enjoy!
